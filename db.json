      "description": "Monstera is a genus of 59 species of flowering plants in the arum family, Araceae, native to tropical regions of the Americas. They are herbs or evergreen vines, growing to heights of 20 metres (66 ft) in trees, climbing by means of aerial roots which act as hooks over branches; these roots will also grow into the soil to help support the plant. Since the plant roots both into the soil and over trees, it is considered a hemiepiphyte.",
